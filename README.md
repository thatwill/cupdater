# cupdater
Updater for Chocolatey.

This application will check for new updates in Chocolatey, and inform the user by toast popup window and system tray icon. The updates can then be started by clicking the toast, or from the system tray.

It is designed to be placed in Windows' Task Scheduler, for automatic checking.

Toast is also public domain code: "Any of my own code posted anywhere on the forum is available for use by others without any restriction of any kind."  
Slightly modified by me.
