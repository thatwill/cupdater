# cupdater
Updater for Chocolatey.

This application will check for new updates in Chocolatey, and inform the user by balloon tip and system tray icon. The updates can then be started from the system tray.

It is designed to be placed in Windows' Task Scheduler, for automatic checking.

Haphazardly written in Autoit. It may not work, it may be broken. Good luck.
